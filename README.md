# KohaDevBox

Create a development environment for the Koha ILS project. It uses Vagrant and Ansible
to set up a VirtualBox. It targets the following tasks:

 * Run all t/ and t/db_dependent tests
 * Sign off patches
 * QA patches
 * Release

##### The KohaDevBox is not suitable for running Koha in production.

## What you get

* A virtual machine running either:

  - Debian 8 (jessie) [*]
  - Debian 7 (wheezy)
  - Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial)
  - Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty)

[*] Default if none specified.

* Latest version of koha-common from the unstable repository (master branch)
  or your custom repository if specified.
* A clone of the official Koha Git repo, or a NFS-mounted git repository from
  your host machine.
* A gitified Koha instance, running off the repo.
* Git-bz set up and ready to use.
* Koha's qa-test-tools set up and ready to use.
* Koha's release-tools set up and ready to use.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/digibib/kohadevbox/issues) for more to come.

## Getting started

## Dependencies

If you don't have them already, you need to install some prerequisites:

* Virtualbox

* Vagrant (version 1.8+): http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

  Note: Ubuntu and Debian ship their own vagrant package, but don't use it. Download the latest version from the above URL.

* Ansible (version 1.9+): http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html

* Git: http://git-scm.com/downloads

Now you can clone the KohaDevBox repository to your local machine and cd into
the directory that was created by the cloning operation:

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/digibib/kohadevbox.git
  $ cd kohadevbox
  $ git checkout origin/master
```

## Usage

### vars/user.yml

Before you start, you need to create a *vars/user.yml* file. KohaDevBox ships a sample
one. You should run:

```
cp vars/user.yml.sample vars/user.yml
```

And then uncomment the lines you would like to change. Usually your personal information,
including your email and bugzilla password (see below for instructions).

### Running Vagrant

Before you start using Vagrant, you will probably want to do this, to speed up
the future installation of packages etc in your VirtualBox:

```
  $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
```

To spin up a new dev box. You need to specify either jessie, wheezy or trusty:

```
  $ vagrant up [<distribution>]
```

Note: ommiting the distribution will default to jessie for all the vagrant * commands.

This will download and install a bunch of stuff, please be patient - especially when 
you are not using `SYNC_REPO` (see below), since then the full Koha repo (which is over 
2GiB) will be cloned too.

If the process somehow gets interrupted, hangs, or otherwise does not get completed, 
you may need to force a re-build of the dev box to make sure everything is installed:

```
  $ vagrant halt [<distribution>]
  $ vagrant up --provision [<distribution>]
```

When everything is done, you should be able to access your dev installation of Koha
at these addresses:

* http://localhost:8080/ Public interface (Apache)
* http://localhost:8081/ Staff interface (Apache)

Until issue #2 has been fixed, you need to log in to the Web UI with the
database user. It defaults to login: `koha_kohadev` and password: `password`

This can be changed before spinning the new box in user.yml.

To log into the newly created box:

```
  $ vagrant ssh [<distribution>]
```

To exit the box, just type "exit".

To save the state of the box, so you can return to it later:

```
  $Â vagrant halt [<distribution>]
```

To destroy the box and all its contents:

```
  $ vagrant destroy [<distribution>]
```

## Aliases

Some aliases are provided to help reduce typing:

* koha-intra-err - tail the intranet error log
* koha-opac-err - tail the OPAC error log
* koha-user - get the db/admin username from koha-conf.xml
* koha-pass - get the db/admin password from koha-conf.xml

## Environment variables

Some of the behaviour of KohaDevBox can be altered through the use of environment
variables. These can be set in a few different ways, depending on how permanent
you want to make them:

On the command line when you run "vagrant up". This will only affect one run of
"vagrant up", and you can change it or leave it out the next time you run
"vagrant up":

```
  $ SYNC_REPO="/home/me/kohaclone" vagrant up
```

On the command line, with export. This will remain in effect for the duration
of your current shell session:

```
  $ export SYNC_REPO="/home/me/kohaclone"
```

In your ~/.bashrc. This will make sure the environment variable is set every
time you start a new shell session:

```
  export SYNC_REPO="/home/me/kohaclone"
```

The available environment variables are:

### SYNC_REPO

Value: The path to an existing Koha Git repo.

Usage:

```
  $ SYNC_REPO="/home/me/kohaclone" vagrant up
```

Sometimes you have an existing Koha Git repo, that you want to "take with you"
into the VirtualBox created by KohaDevBox. Or you want to save some time by
not having KohaDevBox clone lots of large repos every time you spin up a new
box. Or you want to be able to work on the code with your usual tools, regardless
of what is available inside the VirtualBox. Or you have some code that you want
to test on a fresh virtual machine. Then this environment variable is for you.

Please note:

* The repo is synced "both ways", so any changes you make to the repo while you
are inside the box will persist in your repo once you shut down or destroy the
box.
* When you do "vagrant up", the Koha instance configured by the box will run
off whatever branch you had checked out in your pre-existing repo when you ran
"vagrant up".

### KOHA_ELASTICSEARCH

Value: 1

Usage:

```
  $ KOHA_ELASTICSEARCH=1 vagrant up
```

This makes the provisioning scripts install Elasticsearch-related stuff, which is
still in heavy development. This is required for testing ES patches, and is not
enabled by default because it takes more time to complete and not everyone is interested yet.

### PUBLIC_NETWORK

Value: 1

Usage:

```
  $ PUBLIC_NETWORK=1 vagrant up
```

By default, Kohadevbox has two network interfaces set up: one host only adapter, which
allows connections on http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:8081, and a NAT adapter
which is assigned a network address by the host operating system, and allows connections
on ports 80 and 8080. If you want to connect to kohadevbox from a remote machine,
you will need to set the PUBLIC\_NETWORK environment variable; this will set up a
bridged network and get its IP address via the DHCP server on your local network. Note
that Vagrant is [not secure on public networks](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/public_network.html),
so use your own judgement when enabling this.

## Run tests

On a packages environment, you need to use koha-shell to get the proper environment for
running tests. Also, we have set all variables needed for QA tasks on that environment.
To run tests:

```
  $ sudo koha-shell kohadev ; cd kohaclone
  $ prove t/<paste your favourite test>
```

## Run qa-test-tools

An alias is set up so that you can easily run Koha's qa-test-tools when you are
inside your Koha repository clone:

```
  $ sudo koha-shell kohadev ; cd kohaclone
  $ qa -c 7 -v 2
```


## Register with Bugzilla

Register with Bugzilla, Koha's bug tracker, if you have not done so already:

http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/createaccount.cgi

You will need to put your username and password in vars/user.yml (see below), so
do not use a password you have used on other sites.

* [Bug-enhancement-patch Workflow](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Bug-enhancement-patch_Workflow)
* [Git bz](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Git_bz_configuration) is a handy tool to reduce typing

Signing off on patches:

* [Sign off on patches](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Sign_off_on_patches)

Doing development:

* [Coding Guidelines](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Coding_Guidelines)
* [Version Control Using Git](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Version_Control_Using_Git)
* [Commit messages](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Commit_messages)

* [Adding a syspref](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/System_Preferences#Adding_a_new_system_preference)

The [Koha Documentation](http://koha-community.org/documentation/) is highly
recommended for getting to know Koha in general.
